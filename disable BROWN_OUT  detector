if you have problem with usb voltage, you have to use a special smps to convert 5 to 3.3 volt. but, only for testing, you can do this to your code to disable BROWN_OUT  detector:
remember that disabling BROWN_OUT is a very bad idea! only use for test purposes. but in my own experience, I would do it! esp32-c3 is a clunky chip. but only after fixing the voltage problems.
it works on IDF and arduino.


#include "soc/soc.h"
#include "soc/rtc_cntl_reg.h"


void setup(void)
    WRITE_PERI_REG(RTC_CNTL_BROWN_OUT_REG, 0); //disable BROWN_OUT  detector
...
}
